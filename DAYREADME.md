Development Tools
Any developer needs a code editor and a compiler/interpreter.
You can use a debugger when writing JavaScript, asides from a code editor and interpreter.
A debugger lets you take a break and analyze the program’s current state.
The size of your monitor affects how you work; the bigger the screen, the easier it is to use the code editor, interpreter, and other necessary content(s) on the same screen.
Development tools work on any operating system, so it does not matter whether you are using a Linux, MacBook, or Windows computer.
You can install these development tools on your computer locally or use online tools.
With online tools, you do not need to go through the stress of installing any tools.

Online Development Environment
Online environments act as an editor and runtime environment. There are numerous online environments. But they all perform the same way. You can write code, run and test it, and even share it with anyone.
You can use it for training and as a place to publish simple solutions to programming problems.
Popular JavaScript programs include CodePen, JSFiddle, Plunker, and JSBin.


Code Editor

Also known as text editor
Used to write code
Popular examples include VS Code, WebStorm, Sublime Text, Notepad++

Interpreter

Acts as a runtime environment
Checks and detects errors
Errors can include spelling a function name or not closing a parenthesis
The JS interpreter you use depends on the platform you are writing the software for
Node.js is used for a simple server-side application
For client-side apps, web browsers can function as interpreters; the best browsers include Chrome or Firefox

Debugger

It is almost impossible for developers to write codes without errors.
You can only detect some errors while the program is running; debuggers exist for these types of errors.
A debugger lets you slow down or stop the program execution, run the instructions one after the other, and carefully examine the program whenever you want.
When you employ web browsers as interpreters, these web browsers can double as debuggers.
You just have to enable them in your browser.
Your browsers will have tools such as the inspector, JavaScript console, the debugger.
