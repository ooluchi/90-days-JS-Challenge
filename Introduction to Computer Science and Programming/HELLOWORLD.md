## The “Hello World” Program
> “Hello World” is the easiest code when starting out learning a new programming language. It lets us see the most basic syntax of programming languages.

> It is simple, and any newbie can easily write to see if your coding tools and environment are working as they should. It gives feedback if your code was executed correctly or not.

> A console shows various messages
console.log lets us write any information, e.g., “Hello World.” console.log can be a function. The function is nothing more than a log, and the console is the object to which the function belongs.

> Function is simply code that lets you perform a task. You run JavaScript by calling it;  a semi-colon signifies the end of a function call. 

## Online Development Environment
- Write in the browser console 

```js
console.log(“Hello, World”); 
```



## Local development environment 
- Client-side JavaScript only exists online. - JavaScript cannot exist by itself in this configuration. You need to integrate the HTML page into the JavaScript code. 



## The script tag
> You integrate JS code into HTML using the <script> tag. You can either embed it in <script> and </script> tags or use the “src” attribute. Only use the former when the code is short. Use the latter to link a JS file to the HTML file. The script tag is usually in between the HTML <head> and </head> tags.
The browser reads HTML line by line.
